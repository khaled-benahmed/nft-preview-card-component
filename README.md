## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned to use the adjacent sibling selector to make the view icon appear on hover.

```css
.view {
  display: none;
}
.image-container:hover .overlay + .view {
  display: block;
}
```

### Continued development

For future projects I need to focus on using more advanced CSS to create effects.

### Useful resources
